Description:	Head mounted device, for Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
History:
- 2013/05/03 - Created by Paulo Zaffari
Limitations: 

-  If the player will turn the head more than 90 degrees horizontally, 
there will be rotation around the vertical AND horizontal axis while
only rotation around the vertical axis was intended.
While most humans can't turn their heads more than 90 degrees, if one 
would be sitting on a rotating chair or standing, this could be possible
and perceivable.
   In order to avoid the limitation, instead of using deltas of Euler
angles, the view control should take the headset's orientation as 
absolute. Mouse based transformations can still be added on top of the
head mounted device's ones. (for example, to allow the player do 180 
degree turns)

   For devices line the Cinemizer, we can also have a second approach:
- As this device has a mouse emulator, we can disable the device 
choosing sys_CurrentHMDType=0 and enable its mouse tracking by using
sys_EnableCinemizerMouse=1.
