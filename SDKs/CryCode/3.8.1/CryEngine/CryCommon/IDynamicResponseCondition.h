		// Syntax: its called by the DRS system, to evaluate if this condition is fulfilled
		// Description:
		//		the condition is required to check all needed data as fast as possible and return if the response can therefore be executed
		// Arguments:
		//		pObject - a pointer to the current active Actor for this response, can be used to get local variable collections from or use as execution object
		//		pContextVariableCollection - a pointer to the context variable collection for the current event.
		// Returns:
		//		needs to return, if the response is allowed to execute

		// <title Release>
		// Syntax: its called by the DRS system, when this condition instance is no longer needed by the DRS
		// Description:
		//		Informs the Condition that the DRS will not use this instance any more. Its up to the implementation to decide what needs to be done.
		//		The Condition could be deleted, or still remains in some cache so that is can be re-used. straight forward implementation could be a "delete this;"

		// Returns:

		//		Remark: The DRS will call ReleaseCondition for every condition requested through this
		// Arguments:
		//		pConditionNode - an pointer to an cry-xml-node from the response definition which contains the data for the condition.
		// Returns:
		//		Will return the generated or re-used condition if successful. 0 otherwise

		// <title Release>
		// Syntax: its called by the DRS system, on shutdown
		// Description:
		//      Will Release the ActionCreator. Depending on the caching strategy of the creator, it might destroy all created actions. So dont use any Actions of the type after calling release.
		// Arguments:
		// Returns:
		// See Also:
