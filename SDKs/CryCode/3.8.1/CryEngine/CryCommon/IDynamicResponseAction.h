		// Description:
		//      Will Create a new Action with the parameters from the xml-node, or may return a existing one, if a action with these parameters already exist
		// Arguments:
		//		pResponseSegmentNode - an pointer to an cry-xml-node from the response definition which contains the data for action.

		// Syntax: its called by the DRS system, on shutdown
		// Description:
		//      Will Release the ActionCreator. Depending on the caching strategy of the creator, it might destroy all created actions. So dont use any Actions of the type after calling release.
		// Arguments:
		// Returns:

		// Syntax: its called by the DRS system, when a response segment is executed which contains a action of this type
		// Description:
		//      Will execute the action. If the action is not an instantaneous action, it can return an ActionInstance, which is then updated as long as needed by the DRS to finish the execution of the action
		// Arguments:
		//		pResponseInstance - the ResponseInstance that requested the execution of the action. From the ResponseInstance the active actor and the context variables of signal can be obtained, if needed for the execution
		// Returns:
		//		if needed an actionInstance is returned. If the action was already completed during the function 0 will be returned. (For instant-effect-actions like setVariable)
		// See Also:
		//		IResponseInstance
		virtual IResponseActionInstance* Execute(IResponseInstance* pResponseInstance) = 0;

		// <title Release>
		// Syntax: its called by the DRS, when not needed anymore. Normally, when a ResponseSegment is unloaded/destroyed.
		// Description:
		//      Will Release the Action. What is actually happening depends on the implementation, it might decide not to actually destroy it, if the action-creator is caching actions for example.
		//		Must match the allocation strategy used in the corresponding IResponseActionCreator::CreateOrGetActionFromXML)
		// Arguments:
		// Returns:
		// See Also:

		// <title GetVerboseInfo>
		// Syntax: Will be called from the DRS for debug output
		// Description:
		//      Just some debug informations, that describe the action and its parameter. So that a history-log with executed actions can be generated.
		// Arguments:
		// Returns:
		//		a descriptive string containing the action name and its current parameter
		// See Also:
		virtual const string GetVerboseInfo() = 0;

		// <title Update>
		// Syntax: its called by the DRS system, as long as the action instance is running
		// Description:
		//      This method continues the execution of an started action that takes some time to finish. Its called from the DRS System until it stops returning CS_RUNNING.		
		// Arguments:
		// Returns:
		//		returns the current state of the execution of the action. CS_RUNNING means still needs time to finish, CS_FINISHED means finished successful, 
		//		CS_CANCELED means the action was canceled from the outside before it was finished, CS_ERROR means an error happened during execution
		// See Also:
		virtual eCurrentState Update() = 0;

		// <title Cancel>
		// Syntax: its called by the DRS system, when someone requested a cancellation of a running response (segment)
		// Description:
		//      Will be called when someone requested a cancellation of a running response (segment). Its up to the action instance how to handle this request.
		//		There might be cases for example, where the action decides to first finish the current sentence before actually stop. So the DRS will continue updating the ActionInstance, 
		//		until the actionInstance decides to stop (by returning CS_CANCELED or CS_FINISHED in the Update method).
		// Arguments:
		// Returns:
		// See Also:
		//		Update()
		virtual void Cancel() = 0;

		// <title Release>
		// Syntax: its called by the DRS system, when the ActionInstance is no longer needed. Normally when the ActionInstance is finished, or when a running ResponseInstance is destroyed.
		// Description:
		//      Will Release the action instance.  (could be a { delete this; } in most cases. Must match the allocation used in IDynamicResponseAction::Execute)
		// Arguments:
		// Returns:
		// See Also:
		virtual void Release() = 0;  

		// <title GetVerboseInfo>
		// Syntax: For debug only
		// Description:
		//      Just some debug informations, that describe the actionInstance and its parameter and its current process. So that a list of running action instances can be generated
		// Arguments:
		// Returns:
		//		a descriptive string containing informations about the current state of the actionInstance
